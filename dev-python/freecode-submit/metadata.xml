<longdescription lang="en">freecode-submit was originally written to support remote submission of release updates to Freecode via its JSON API, intended for use in project release scripts. Since the shutdown of Freecode on 18 June 2014 it has been adapted to talk to Freshcode, and may in future support other Freecode successors if and as they materialize. It reads the metadata from an RFC-2822-like message on standard input, possibly with overrides by command-line switches.
